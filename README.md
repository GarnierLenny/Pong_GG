# Pong_GG
Pong_GG is a pong-like game made with ncurses library

Type "make" to generate the pong_GG binary, then "./pong_GG" to launch the game.
Once started the game will ask you to set the next game point limit, don't worry it will ask it after each game.
For now this game only has a 2 players mode.
Player 1 move his paddle with 'A' and 'S' keys, player 2 moves his with 'P' and 'M' keys.
This project isn't finished yet, I'll keep you uptaded.
